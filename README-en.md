# Voxudio

[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÊú¨](README.md)

Voxudio is a project focused on speech processing and voice conversion, providing a complete set of tools for audio capture, playback, voice activity detection, speaker feature extraction, and voice conversion.

## Project Overview

Voxudio project offers implementations in multiple languages to meet different development environments and performance requirements:

- **Python Implementation**: Located in the project root directory, suitable for rapid prototyping and research
- **Rust Implementation**: Located in the [voxudio-rs](voxudio-rs) directory, providing high performance and cross-platform support

## Core Features

- üé§ **Audio Device Management**
    - Audio Capture: Supports capturing data from various audio input devices
    - Audio Playback: Supports real-time audio playback
- üîç **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**
    - Real-time detection of speech activity in audio
    - Accurate distinction between speech and non-speech segments
- üë§ **Speaker Embedding Extraction (SEE)**
    - Extracts 256-dimensional speaker feature vectors
    - Supports speaker identification and verification
- üé≠ **Tone Color Conversion (TCC)**
    - Real-time voice conversion
    - Preserves original speech content and emotion

## Usage Guide

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation provides the following main modules:

- `vad.py`: Voice Activity Detection
- `see.py`: Speaker Embedding Extraction
- `tcc.py`: Tone Color Conversion

Example usage:

```python
# Voice Activity Detection example
import vad

# Speaker Embedding Extraction example
import see

# Tone Color Conversion example
import tcc
```

### Rust Implementation

The Rust implementation offers higher performance and broader platform support. For detailed information, please refer to [voxudio-rs/README.md](voxudio-rs/README.md).
